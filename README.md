# JNFS-Small (JNFSS)
<br>
A filesystem I made in my free time.
And there's still a bunch of issues I need to fix.

## Notice
<br>
This project and its code will not be updated anymore due to spaghetti code
I would rewrite the entire project if I were to update it and release it in a seperate repository. But I would like to reuse the concept in a future project.

## Filesystem's purpose
<br>
A challenge I made on how good I am at programming now.
