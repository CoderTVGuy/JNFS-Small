# JNFS-Small (JNFSS)
<br>
A filesystem I made in my free time.

## Notice
<br>
This project and its code will not be updated anymore due to poorly written code.
If I were to update the project most likely I would rewrite the entire project's code and I would release it in a seperate repository. 
But I would like to reuse the concept in a future project.

## Filesystem's purpose
<br>
A challenge I made on how good I am at programming now by making a filesystem.
